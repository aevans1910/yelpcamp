## Yelp Camp

This code represents the full stack website, Yelp Camp, in which one can find and list campsites that are available throughout the United States.

## Motivation

The pandemic has been hard on everyone. No one knows what to do, where to go, and pandemic burnout is setting in fast. There has therefore been a 
new push for outdoor activities, such as hiking, biking, and even camping. Because of this, I wanted to make a user oriented site to find the best
camping spots for you and your needs.

## Where it is now

This website is a fullstack website with basic CRUD and authentication. One can create an account, post listings, edit those listings, delete them,
and even post reviews on them. If one simply wants to see all the campsites, one does not even need to make an account.
